# Steganography

Steganography can be described as "the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video."

This Steganography Python class can be used to merge two images (hide one image inside another).

> The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.

Note that the second image (the image which will be hidden/merged) needs to be at most the same size of the first image.
